// This is basic hello world node Program
//Node works same as JS hence only one file is required for this example
//Since node can run outside the browser, we use a different command to see the output in the terminal
// In terminal, run : node welcome.js
//Runnig this will run js outside the browser, hence Node in action

console.log("Hello world");
